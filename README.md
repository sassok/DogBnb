* THIS FUCKING THING

I mean WOAW, that was a big piece to chew ! I don't even... and I'm all like !! 
This WAS a challenge, one we didn't come though obviously.
Although, it was formidable. I did enjoy myself very much, even though I whould have liked to have a bit more help regarding the whole mess that are those BDDs (in french please). but yeah, hell of a piece of work, which i'm, again, not over with. 
But I do hope I'll get to work on other of the same stuff, because although it hit me HARD on the head, i had a really great time !!

That being said, I have to get going. 

Best of luck for testing this bad boy, i'm not far from the solution, juste far enough that it looks like nothing is happening.
Be warned : stuff IS indeed happening. You just can't see it. 
Because I guess I fucked up somewhere along the way

Feel free to point out where
